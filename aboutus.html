<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:algerian;">History of​ Taxation Pre – 1922</h1>
<p>"It was only for the good of his subjects that he collected taxes from them, just as the Sun draws moisture from the Earth to give it back a thousand fold" 
–--<i class="a">Kalidas in Raghuvansh eulogizing KING DALIP.</i></p>
<p class="b">
It is a matter of general belief that taxes on income and wealth are of recent origin but there is enough evidence to show that taxes on income in some form
or the other were levied even in primitive and ancient communities. The origin of the word "Tax" is from "Taxation" which means an estimate. These were levied 
either on the sale and purchase of merchandise or livestock and were collected in a haphazard manner from time to time. Nearly 2000 years ago, there went out a
 decree from Ceaser Augustus that all the world should be taxed. In Greece, Germany and Roman Empires, taxes were also levied sometime on the basis of turnover and 
sometimes on occupations. For many centuries, revenue from taxes went to the Monarch. In Northern England, taxes were levied on land and on moveable property such as 
the Saladin title in 1188. Later on, these were supplemented by introduction of poll taxes, and indirect taxes known as "Ancient Customs" which were duties on wool,
 leather and hides. These levies and taxes in various forms and on various commodities and professions were imposed to meet the needs of the Governments to meet their 
military and civil expenditure and not only to ensure safety to the subjects but also to meet the common needs of the citizens like maintenance of roads, 
administration of justice and such other functions of the State.

Collection of Income-tax was well organised and it constituted a major part of the revenue of the State.
 A big portion was collected in the form of income-tax from dancers, musicians, actors and dancing girls,
 etc. This taxation was not progressive but proportional to the fluctuating income. An excess Profits Tax
 was also collected. General Sales-tax was also levied on sales and the sale and the purchase of buildings
 was also subject to tax. Even gambling operations were centralised and tax was collected on these operations
. A tax called yatravetana was levied on pilgrims. Though revenues were collected from all possible sources, 
the underlying philosophy was not to exploit or over-tax people but to provide them as well as to the State 
and the King, immunity from external and internal danger. The revenues collected in this manner were spent on
 social services such as laying of roads, setting up of educational institutions, setting up of new villages
 and such other activities beneficial to the community.

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:algerian;">History of​ Taxation Post – 1922</h1>
<h3>1. Preliminary :</h3>
<p>The rapid changes in administration of direct taxes, during the last decades, reflect the history of 
socio-economic thinking in India. From 1922 to the present day changes in direct tax laws have been so 
rapid that except in the bare outlines, the traces of the I.T. Act, 1922 can hardly be seen in the 1961
 Act as it stands amended to date. It was but natural, in these circumstances, that the set up of the 
department should not only expand but undergo structural changes as well.
</p>
<h3>2. Changes in administrative set up since the inception of the department:</h3>
<p>The organisational history of the Income-tax Department starts in the year 1922. The Income-tax Act, 1922, 
gave, for the first time, a specific nomenclature to various Income-tax authorities. The foundation of a proper
 system of administration was thus laid. In 1924, Central Board of Revenue Act constituted the Board as a statutory
 body with functional responsibilities for the administration of the Income-tax Act. Commissioners of 
Income- tax were appointed separately for each province and Assistant Commissioners and Income-tax Officers 
were provided under their control. The amendments to the Income tax Act, in 1939, made two vital structural 
changes: (i) appellate functions were separated from administrative functions; a class of officers, known as 
Appellate Assistant Commissioners, thus came into existence, and (ii) a central charge was created in Bombay.
 In 1940, with a view to exercising effective control over the progress and inspection of the work of Income-tax 
Department throughout India, the very first attached office of the Board, called Directorate of Inspection 
(Income Tax) - was created. As a result of separation of executive and judicial functions, in 1941, the Appellate
 Tribunal came into existence. In the same year, a central charge was created in Calcutta also.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>World War II brought unusual profits to businessmen. During 1940 to 1947, Excess Profits Tax and 
Business Profits Tax were introduced and their administration handed over to the Department (These were later
 repealed in 1946 and 1949 respectively). In 1951, the 1st Voluntary Disclosure Scheme was brought in. It was
 during this period, in 1946, that a few Group 'A' officers were directly recruited. Later on in 1953, the Group
 'A' Service was formally constituted as the 'Indian Revenue Service'.
        </p></li>
    <li><p>This era was characterised by considerable emphasis on development of investigation techniques.
 In 1947, Taxation on Income (Investigation) Commission was set up which was declared ultra vires by the
 Supreme Court in 1956 but the necessity of deep investigation had by then been realised. In 1952, the
 Directorate of Inspection (Investigation) was set up. It was in this year that a new cadre known as Inspectors
 of Income Tax was created. The increase in 'large income' cases necessitated checking of the work done by 
departmental officers. Thus in 1954, the Internal Audit Scheme was introduced in the Income-tax Department.
        </p></li>
    <li><p>As indicated earlier, in 1946, for the first time a few Group A officers were recruited in the
 department. Training them was important. The new recruits were sent to Bombay and Calcutta where they were
 trained, though not in an organised manner. In 1957, I.R.S. (Direct Taxes) Staff College started functioning
 in Nagpur. Today this attached office of the Board functions under a Director-General. It is called the National 
Academy of Direct Taxes. By 1963, the I.T. department, burdened with the administration of several other Acts
 like W.T., G.T., E.D., etc., had expanded to such an extent that it was considered necessary to put it under a
 separate Board. Consequently, the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963 was passed. The Central Board of Direct 
Taxes was constituted, under this Act.</p></li>
   <li><p>The developing nature of the economy of the country brought with it both steep rates of taxes and 
black incomes. In 1965, the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme was brought in followed by the 1975 Disclosure Scheme. 
Finally, the need for a permanent settlement mechanism resulted in the creation of the Settlement Commission.
</p></li>
     <li><p>A very important administrative change occurred during this period. The recovery of arrears of tax 
which till 1970 was the function of State authorities was passed on to the departmental officers. A whole new 
wing of Officers - Tax Recovery Officers was created and a new cadre of post of Tax Recovery Commissioners was
 introduced w.e.f. 1-1-1972.
